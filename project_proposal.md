# Coop logger

## Objective

To take in data from a remote data logger in my chicken coop, store the data and make it accessible as visually appealing charts and graphs. 

## Tech Stack

An Express API hosted on heroku connected to a MySQL dab hosted on HostGator. I will use Sequalize as my ORM, Passport for authentication and authorization.
The front-end will be built with React using Recharts for data visualization, Redux for state management, axios for HTTP interaction.
Both the API and Front-end will be written in TypeScript.

## User Stories

As a data source,
I should be able to upload temperature, humidity, charging state, and door lock data
So that it can be saved and viewed later.

As a user,
I should be able to view data in different date ranges
So that I can see historical trends in the data.

As a user,
I should be able to compare different sets of data
So that I can see comparative trends in the data.

This will be another opportunity to rebuild an existing project to advance and solidify my knowledge of the tech. This project will use an already extensive data set from the past year of data logged already and will challenge me to manage so much data and create interactive charts to display the data in different ways. I think this project, because it is already a passion project of mine, will show off my ability to work with different types of data inputs and data manipulation.
